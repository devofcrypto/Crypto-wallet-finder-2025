Crypto wallet finder - Software to find lost crypto wallets - Wallet Finder - Crypto Checker

Wallet Gen is a tool designed for brute force and generating cryptocurrency wallets (such as Bitcoin and EVM-based wallets like ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.), as well as discovering forgotten or lost wallets that contain an existing balance.

Overview
Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source, allowing anyone to access and modify the code.
Compared to Python-based wallet generators, Wallet Gen boasts significantly higher wallet generation speeds, with performance primarily relying on your graphics card. 
For generating EVM wallets (ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.), Wallet Gen uses the keccak256 algorithm, while Bitcoin wallets are created using the Segwit format under Bech32.

My Finds
I’ve personally recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).
